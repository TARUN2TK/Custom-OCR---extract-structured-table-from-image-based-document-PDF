Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Engine for extracting structured table information from scanned images or PDFs

Tables are among the most common means of presenting and structuring data with high information density in any document including PDFs. This OCR engine extract structured table data in sequential manner from scanned images or PDFs and works fine for regular tables.

This script(ocr_table_complete.py) takes a PDF file as input, processes it and returns a 'data.txt' file with structured table information in text format. The script also logs exception which can be studied from 'ocr_errors.txt' file.

Please study 'Case Study on Ocr' doc file to understand the algorithm used.
